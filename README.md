# Water Level Tracker

## Description

The Water Level Tracker is a web-based application that simulates a 2-liter goblet and 8 smaller 250 ml goblets. The application tracks the water level in the 2-liter goblet and displays the remaining space and water level percentage based on the selected 250 ml goblet.

## Features

- **Real-time Water Level Tracking**: Updates the current water level in the 2-liter goblet.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The system starts with a full 2-liter goblet.
2. **Interaction**: Click any of the 250 ml goblets.
3. **Display**: The water level in the 2-liter goblet, the remaining space in liters, and the water level percentage are updated according to the selected goblet.
